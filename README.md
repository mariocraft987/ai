# artificial idiot
this is a program created by breakfast, someone with too much free time on their hands.
## what makes it different?
other AIs learn by scraping data from the web, so i'm attempting to make an artificial intelligence by training it off of data entered manually. contributions are much appreciated. and yes i'm aware this is a silly idea
## what's an updata?
it's an *update* to the AI's *data.* get it? *update data? updata?* hhahahhah
